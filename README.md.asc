# speaks
an i2p power user's take on i2p.

wherein I clumsily try to make the case for tooling that exists conceptually
somwhere between "web interface" and "core development" and propose ways to
grow the community of i2p power-users to the benefit of all.

This is for positive representation of power users during the i2p redesign, and
is **absolutely not** intended to discount the needs of beginners. @eyedeekay
believes that the ability of experienced users to provide support and
suggestions is a resource that can benefit beginners. The second and third part
are actually pretty much suggestions for things advanced i2p users could make
organized efforts to do.
