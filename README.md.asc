# speaks
an i2p power user's take on i2p.

wherein I clumsily try to make the case for tooling that exists conceptually
somwhere between "web interface" and "core development" and propose ways to
grow the community of i2p power-users to the benefit of all.

This is for positive representation of power users during the i2p redesign, and
is **absolutely not** intended to discount the needs of beginners. @eyedeekay
believes that the ability of experienced users to provide support and
suggestions is a resource that can benefit beginners. The second and third part
are actually pretty much suggestions for things advanced i2p users could make
organized efforts to do. It could even be characterized as a Call to Arms for
i2p power users to help show off what i2p can do and make it an easier network
for people to immediately benefit from using.
